## ✅ Requirements

To run the **Tetris** game, you need the following:

- **Python 3.6+** installed on your system
- **Tkinter** (usually included with standard Python distributions)
- No external libraries are required

### 🔍 Check if Tkinter is installed

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -m tkinter
```

If a small window opens, Tkinter is correctly installed.

### 📦 Optional

If using a minimal installation of Python (like some Linux distributions), you may need to install Tkinter manually:

- **Ubuntu/Debian**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install python3-tk
  ```

- **Arch Linux**:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S tk
  ```

- **Windows/Mac**:
  Tkinter is usually bundled with Python. Make sure you’ve downloaded Python from the [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
